OSPool Resources for Teaching & Education
====================================

The OSPool provides a ***free, ready-to-use*** platform for instructors who are teaching high throughput computing concepts for academic courses, conference workshops, and other events. 

Instructors can choose for their students to have Guest or Full Accounts on the OSPool. For Guest Accounts, students/attendees can launch an OSPool Notebook at any time and practice job submission with smaller workflows. For Full Accounts, students/attendees will need to request an account (which will be approved within one business day), but then are able to submit large scale high throughput computing workflows free of charge. 

The table below outlines suggested steps for bringing OSPool resources to your training or event. Please reach out to the facilitation team at any time if you have questions or want to chat about your goals.

    <th>Evaluate Guest or Full Account for Attendees</th>
    <td><b>Option 1: Guest OSPool Accounts</b>
      <br>
      <br>
      You are welcome have your attendees use an OSPool Guest Acccount for the event.
      <br>
      <br>
      This is a good option for events that:
      <br>
      <br>
      - may not know registrants in advance 
      <br>
      - run less than 4 hours, or can easily recreate files that may be lost upon session time out (4 hours)
      <br>
      <br>
      - want to only use a notebook interface
    </td>
        <td><b>Option 2: Full OSPool Accounts</b>
      <br>
      <br>
      You can request that your students have the ability to submit jobs to the OSPool using Full Accounts. 
      <br>
      <br>
      This is a good option for events that:
      <br>
      <br>
      - know registrants in advance 
      <br>
      - will run for more than 1-2 days
      <br>
      - with more than 50 participants
      <br>
      - would like jobs to access the full capacity of the OSPool
      - would like to submit jobs using a notebook or classic terminal interface

    <th>Prior to the Event</th>
    <td colspan="2"> 
      If using full accounts, the instructor will provide a list of participants to the OSG Research Facilitation Team, and participants should request an account a few days in advance of the event (does not apply to guest accounts). It is also good practice to test your full workshop code and any software on your account of choice.

## Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs)
<details>
<summary>Why use OSPool resources for my course/event?</summary>
  <br>
  OSPool resources provide a free, easy-to-use toolkit for you to use to teach computing concepts at your next course/event. Event attendees do not need 
  an account, but can request continued access to use OSPool resources for their own research.
  <br>
  <br>
  The OSPool staff also offer free assistance with helping you convert an existing workflow to work on the OSPool. We provide guidance about using OSG 
  resources, using HTCondor, and are happy to answer any questions you may have regarding our resources. 
  <br>
</details>

<details>
<summary>If I request full accounts for my students/attendees, when will their accounts be deactivated?</summary>
  <br>
  We work with instructors to choose a date that works well for their event, but typically accounts are deactivated several days after the event 
  completes. If attendees are interested in continuing to use OSPool resources for their research, they can request their account remains active by 
  emailing support@osg-htc.org.
  <br>
</details>


<details>
<summary>Do you have slides and video recordings of workshops that used OSPool resources to help me prepare for my event(s)?</summary>
  <br>
  Yes!
  <br>
  <br>
  We provide hands-on tutorial materials for topics such as running common software or workflows on the OSPool (e.g., python, R, MATLAB, bioinformatic   
  workflows), recordings of tutorials and introductory materials, presentation slides, and other materials. Some of the materials are linked under the 
  Teaching Resources section above.
</details>


<details>
<summary>When should I not use OSPool resources for my course/event?</summary>
  <br>
  Events are typically bound by the same limitations as regular users/jobs. This means that any event needing to use licensed software or submit
  individual multi-core jobs or jobs running longer than 20 hours may not be a good fit for our system.
  <br>
</details>

<details>
<summary>Who should I contact with questions or concerns?</summary>
  <br>
  The OSG Research Computing Facilitation Team is happy to answer any questions or concerns you may have about using OSPool resources for your event(s). Please direct questions to support@osg-htc.org. A Facilitator will respond within one business day.
