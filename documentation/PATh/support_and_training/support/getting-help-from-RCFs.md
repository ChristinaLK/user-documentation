Email, Office Hours, and 1-1 Meetings 
====================================
 

*There are multiple ways to get help from PATh’s Research Computing Facilitators. Get in touch anytime!*


## Research Computing Facilitators

To help researchers effectively utilize computing resources, our
Research Computing Facilitators (RCFs) not only assist you in
implementing your computational work on PATh compute resources, but can
also point you to other services related to research computing and data
needs. 

## Help via Email

We provide ongoing support via email to support@path-cc.io, and it’s
never a bad idea to start by sending questions or issues via email. You
can typically expect a first response within a few business hours.


## Virtual Office Hours

Drop-in for live help, available every Tuesday and Thursday:

- Tuesdays, 4-5:30pm ET / 1-2:30pm PT
- ~~Thursdays, 11:30am-1pm ET / 8:30-10am PT~~ (Canceled during the summer)

You can find the URL to the Virtual Office Hours meeting room when you
log into a PATh access point, or in the signature of a support email
from an RCF.

Click [here](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSd3K78Xx1Vo-KjqW_2y0YKcUMXrEsKXWk3I1Aww64RL22QpnQ/viewform) to sign-in for office hours, once you arrive in the room. 

## Make an Appointment

We are happy to arrange meetings outside of designated Office Hours, per
your preference. Simply email us at support@path-cc.io, and we will set
up a time to meet!
