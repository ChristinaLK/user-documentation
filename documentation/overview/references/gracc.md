OSG Accounting (GRACC)
======================

GRACC is the Open Science Pool's accounting system. If you need graphs or high level statistics
on your OSG usage, please go to:

[https://gracc.opensciencegrid.org/](https://gracc.opensciencegrid.org/)

GRACC contains an overwhelming amount of data. As an OSPool user, you are most
likely interested in seeing your own usage over time. This can be found under
the _Open Science Pool - All Usage_ dashboard [here](https://gracc.opensciencegrid.org/d/000000077/open-science-pool-all-usage)

Under the _Project_ drop-down, find your project. You can select multiple ones.

In the upper right corner, you can select a different time period. You can then select a
different _Bin size_ time range. For example, if you want data for the last year grouped
monthly, select "Last 1 year" for the _Period_, and "1M" for the _Bin size_.

Here is an example of what the information provided will look like:
